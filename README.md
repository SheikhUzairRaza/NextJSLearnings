# Next.js Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Next.js Learning Journey**! This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning and development process with the Next.js framework. Here, I will be pushing assignments, practice projects, and other tasks as I explore various concepts and techniques related to Next.js.

## Repository Contents

The repository will contain:

- **Assignments:** A collection of tasks or challenges completed as part of my learning process.
- **Practice Projects:** Small to medium-sized projects that demonstrate different features and concepts of Next.js.
- **Notes & Learnings:** Any key takeaways, code snippets, or notes that I find useful for future reference.
- **Solutions to Problems:** Whenever I encounter specific challenges, Iâ€™ll be documenting the approach and solutions.

## Learning Goals

Through this repository, I aim to:

- Master the core concepts of Next.js, such as routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering.
- Explore the integration of Next.js with other tools like React, Tailwind CSS, and APIs.
- Improve my coding skills by working on real-world scenarios.
- Track my progress and reflect on areas for improvement.
